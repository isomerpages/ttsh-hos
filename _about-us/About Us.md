The Hospitals of Singapore (HOS) Network drives collective leadership for the future of hospitals in Singapore. It was inaugurated on 1 September 2023 and has 12 hospital members across the three healthcare clusters in Singapore - National Healthcare Group (NHG), National University Health System (NUHS) and Singapore Health Services (SHS). The HOS Network is hosted by the Centre for Healthcare Innovation (CHI).

The HOS Network is hosted by the Centre for Healthcare Innovation (CHI). CHI is committed to transform healthcare, driven by its three thrusts: Promoting a culture of innovation through thought leadership, achieve better health and healthcare by enabling workforce transformation, and to catalyse value-based outcomes by effecting systems-level change.

Founded in 2016 on the concept of co-learning and collaboration, CHI and its network of 87 like-minded local and international partners create thought leadership, as well as co-build initiatives and programmes to inculcate a culture of innovation within healthcare.

Strengthened by this network, CHI has been able to customise and design signature programmes that aim to build a sustainable workforce via new andragogy and paradigms for our communities of carers and patients. To catalyse value-based outcomes and effect systems-level change, CHI's impactful platforms and initiatives drive innovation adoption and knowledge translation, consequently giving the healthcare community quicker access to the latest innovations.
