##### About the Host:~~~~

CHI is committed to transform healthcare, driven by its three thrusts: Promoting a culture of innovation through thought leadership, achieve better health and healthcare by enabling workforce transformation, and to catalyse value-based outcomes by effecting systems-level change.

Founded in 2016 on the concept of co-learning and collaboration, CHI and its network of 87 like-minded local and international partners create thought leadership, as well as co-build initiatives and programmes to inculcate a culture of innovation within healthcare.

Strengthened by this network, CHI has been able to customise and design signature programmes that aim to build a sustainable workforce via new andragogy and paradigms for our communities of carers and patients. To catalyse value-based outcomes and effect systems-level change, CHI's impactful platforms and initiatives drive innovation adoption and knowledge translation, consequently giving the healthcare community quicker access to the latest innovations.
