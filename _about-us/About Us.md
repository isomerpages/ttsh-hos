##### About the Centre for Healthcare Innovation

The Centre for Healthcare Innovation (CHI), hosted by NHG Health, serves as a transformation engine driving innovation across Singapore’s healthcare system. We innovate for future care, for future health, for future generations — by harnessing the power of our innovation cycle. This begins with redesigning care models to meet evolving needs, integrating smart technologies to enhance delivery, and reshaping workforce roles to build resilience and adaptability. CHI’s work spans multiple levels of impact: improving value at the point of care, enabling health and social change at the systems level, and cultivating a sustainable healthcare ecosystem for generations to come&nbsp;— driven by the goal of adding years of healthy life&nbsp;and shaping a healthier future for all.

**Together, we are one health system that can inspire and care for the health of our population.**
