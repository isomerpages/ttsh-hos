<summary>Driving A Culture of Quality Improvement ‚Äì The CGH Kaizen Everyday Engagement
Programme (KEEP) Journey</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>‚ÄúSmall Action + Passion = Big Change‚Äù - CGH has successfully transformed
its workplace culture through an innovative ground-up improvement initiative
that proves small changes can yield remarkable results. By employing visual
Kaizen boards across departments, staff at all levels were able to freely
identify challenges and implement solutions, and has revolutionised how
frontline healthcare staff contribute to operational excellence.</p>
<p>The initiative's success is exemplified by numerous impactful innovations,
including the introduction of tamper-proof bags for patient belongings
- a solution that eliminated time-consuming manual recording processes
and was subsequently adopted across hospitals within SingHealth. The programme's
strength lies in its accessibility and immediate impact. Staff-led improvements,
from modified medical supply carriers to innovative patient mobility solutions,
demonstrate how small, cost-effective changes can significantly enhance
both staff efficiency and patient care. The initiative has fostered a culture
where every employee feels empowered to contribute to workplace improvement.</p>
<p>Driving a culture of quality improvement within CGH showcases how empowering
frontline staff can lead to meaningful healthcare innovations.</p>

<summary>Frequent Readmitter Programme ‚Äì Holistic Multi-Disciplinary Approach for
Frequent Readmitters</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>The Frequent Readmitter (FR) Programme was established to develop effective
and robust processes for proactive identification and management of patients
with a pre-determined number of readmission episodes within a year.The
committee gleaned insights on common FR profiles and past interventions
from initial case reviews to elicit four main patient profiles which are
used to guide patient identification and recommended interventions. The
team also recognised the need for a holistic approach involving different
care providers across inpatient, outpatient and community settings.</p>
<p>Today, with the appointment of a Primary Doctor (PD), oversight of patient
care plans and admissions has not only enabled relationship building and
gathering of consensus among a diverse team, but also serves as a platform
to discuss perspectives and align care goals for patients‚Äô benefit. Care
plans not only address medical needs, but also the social and support needs
of the patient.</p>
<p>The FR Programme remains as one of TTSH's strategic projects, with hospital
readmissions during the period of January to October 2018 reflected a 60%
reduction in the number of patients with &gt;7 readmission episodes, and
3066 patient days avoided with a projected cost avoidance of $3,066,000.</p>
