<summary>Accelerating Alexandra Hospital’s sustainability with SAT</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>Alexandra Hospital's Go Green programme leveraged the Sustainability Accelerator
Tool (SAT) to achieve comprehensive sustainability improvements across
operations and clinical settings. The hospital successfully implemented
low-carbon care practices including reusable cutlery and instruments, canister-form
wipes, and optimised blood tube inventory management, with the cutlery
transition alone projected to eliminate 450,000 single-use items annually.
Improvements to energy efficiency through LED lighting, temperature optimisation,
and HVAC upgrades complemented enhanced waste management. In addressing
the concerns about potential compromises to infection control standards
when reducing the use of disposable gowns and gloves, the team also collaborated
with Infection Prevention &amp; Control Nursing to develop evidence-based
protocols maintaining safety standards.</p>
<p>The programme achieved exceptional staff engagement with over 50% workforce
participation by FY25 through expanded environmental training and monthly
sustainability meetings. By systematically embedding sustainability into
operational processes and organisational culture through SAT's benchmarking
framework, AH has created a robust system ensuring environmental considerations
are integral to decision-making, positioning the hospital for sustained
long-term sustainability improvements.</p>

<summary>Future-proofing healthcare: Optimizing sustainability at Changi General
Hospital while upholding the highest standards of clinical excellence and
care</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>Changi General Hospital transformed from having limited climate planning
and minimal staff engagement to establishing a framework using the Sustainability
Accelerator Tool (SAT). Following the formation of a dedicated sustainability
committee in November 2023, CGH systematically upskilled staff in data
collection and analysis whilst introducing measurable targets for initiatives.
CGH achieved remarkable carbon reduction wins including a 94% reduction
in nitrous oxide leakage saving 400 tons of CO2e, and an impressive 805
tons of CO2e savings from desflurane reduction between 2019 and 2024 representing
a 90% drop from peak usage. Energy efficiency improvements through solar
panel installations and heat recovery systems reduced Scope 2 emissions,
whilst Scope 3 advances included reusable product transitions, telehealth
expansion, green procurement policies, and enhanced biohazard waste education.</p>
<p>Building on this success, CGH plans to establish a formal sustainability
office with comprehensive education programmes, dedicated funding for larger
projects, and fostering a motivated workforce where sustainability practices
extend beyond work to transform lifestyles, positioning the hospital as
a leader in healthcare sustainability.</p>

<summary>Accelerating the Green Movement at TTSH</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>Tan Tock Seng Hospital embarked on a Green Movement initiative to address
healthcare's significant carbon footprint by using the Sustainability Accelerator
Tool (SAT), which helped TTSH in comparing and evaluating sustainability
efforts across various dimensions. This also led to establishing measurable
targets and a formal structure including an ESG Council and dedicated Sustainability
Office. The hospital achieved impressive operational wins including a cataract
surgery review that reduced single-use consumables by over 700kg, recycled
more than 2,000kg of waste, saved S$2,000, and decreased CO2 emissions
by over 2,000kg. Additional successes included a recycling pilot diverting
over five tons of waste and a Food Rescue initiative minimising event food
waste.</p>
<p></p>
<p>TTSH has made substantial progress towards sustainability targets. With
enhanced staff training, dedicated funding for green initiatives, and robust
sustainability framework in place, TTSH is well-positioned to scale green
efforts sustainably and plans to integrate SAT as a regular feature for
benchmarking against international standards.</p>

<h2><strong>🏅 Honourable Mention</strong></h2>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Dr Prathap C Reddy</em> Excellence Award for Clinical Quality and Patient

<p><strong>National University Hospital</strong>

<summary>Optimizing care in cellulitis patients</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>NUH's Acute Medical Unit successfully transformed care for cellulitis
patients by addressing two critical bottlenecks: overuse of unnecessary
blood cultures and inefficient discharge processes. Through comprehensive
stakeholder education on evidence-based blood culture indications and streamlined
discharge pathways to community physicians, outpatient antibiotic therapy
centres, and specialist clinics, the project achieved remarkable improvements.
Appropriate blood culture ordering surged from just 6% to an impressive
98%, whilst early discharge rates more than doubled from 48% to over 80%.</p>
<p></p>
<p>These improvements delivered substantial benefits including approximately
S$1,000 cost savings per patient, reduced financial burden on families,
enhanced bed capacity utilisation, and improved patient care quality through
evidence-based practices. Building on this success, NUH is expanding the
initiative across other wards and broadening scope to include additional
clinical conditions like pneumonia over the next six months.</p>

<summary>Alexandra Hospital’s Go Green programme</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>Alexandra Hospital's Go Green programme successfully transformed hospital
sustainability practices after frontline staff raised concerns about inefficient
practices including excessive consumable use, overcooling of rooms, and
ineffective recycling. The comprehensive three-phase initiative aligned
with NUHS environmental goals across four key areas: carbon reduction,
energy efficiency, waste management, and staff engagement. Starting with
awareness-building waste tours and staff workshops in 2022, AH progressed
to Green Ward and Clinic pilots in 2023, introducing reusable cutlery,
reduced packaging waste, and digital workflows that achieved impressive
25-30% recycling rates in operating theatres and clinics.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The programme delivered substantial environmental wins including over
1,100 CO2e reduction in Scope 1 emissions, 1.2 million sheets of paper
saved through digitalisation, and 10% reduction in energy use intensity.
By institutionalising environmental standards into risk management frameworks
and Joint Commission International compliance, AH has embedded sustainability
into core operations. Moving forward, AH is in the process of developing
a Green Mark Super Low Energy hospital by 2028, positioning itself as a
model for sustainable healthcare delivery.</p>
