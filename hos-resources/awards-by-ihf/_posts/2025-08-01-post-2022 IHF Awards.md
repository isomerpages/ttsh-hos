<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>In 2020, a Staff Well-being Team was established in TTSH in response to
the pandemic with the goal of maintaining morale, instilling well-being,
and helping distressed staff cope with the unrelenting stress. The team
also extended their support and engaged with key stakeholders, such as
the hospital's tenants and ancillary staff.</p>
<p></p>
<p>To help staff thrive during the outbreak, sensing mechanisms such as pulse
surveys, staff support helplines and nominated Welfare Officers from every
department enabled the Staff Well-being Team to track challenges and real-time
feedback. Concerns were escalated to management to be addressed for quick
interventions to be developed. These included the Spread a Smile Movement,
psychological preparedness toolkits, mobile microlearning on stress management,
virtual exercise and healthy living communities, bot-facilitated cognitive
behavioural therapy, and appreciation boards where members of the community
penned gratitude notes.</p>
<p></p>
<p>TTSH saw positive results as staff‚Äôs self-reported resilience was maintained
between 5.8-6.1 out of 10 from 2020 to mid-2021. Several of the interventions
have also been continuously adopted as best practices throughout.</p>

</p>
<p>The Hospital Without Walls digital innovation programme revolutionises
healthcare delivery by extending care beyond physical boundaries and redesigned
with digitalisation as the key enabler.</p>
<p>Projects include the Healthcare Intelligence (HI) system that empowers
TTSH to proactively identify at-risk patients and enable timely interventions,
with 55% of frequent admitters experiencing reduced readmissions in 2019.
The initiative's success is further enhanced through Smart Wards, such
as Ward 5C, which serve as a testing ground for cutting-edge technologies
including smart beds and delivery robots.</p>
<p>Community integration has been strengthened through the Central Health
LinkUp network of approximately 20 partners, allowing healthcare staff
from various institutions collaborate to align care plans and ensure continuity
of care for the patient.</p>
<p>TTSH's digitalisation strategy, firmly rooted in population health principles,
continues to evolve through active collaboration with residents, caregivers,
and community providers. This comprehensive approach transforms traditional
healthcare delivery into a relationship-based, integrated care system supported
by innovative technology to reimagine and redesign care with patients and
partners.</p>
