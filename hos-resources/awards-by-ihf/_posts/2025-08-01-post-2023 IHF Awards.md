<summary>Enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS¬Æ)</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>TTSH revolutionised its surgical care approach by implementing the Enhanced
Recovery After Surgery (ERAS¬Æ) programme, recognising that post-operative
recovery extends far beyond the operating theatre. Coordinated by dedicated
multidisciplinary teams, ERAS¬Æ delivers evidence-based subspecialty surgery
protocols through integrated multimodal approaches, spanning from preoperative
preparation through to discharge.</p>
<p>Since its introduction in colorectal surgery in 2016, ERAS¬Æ has successfully
expanded to encompass 10 surgical subspecialties. The programme's primary
focus on minimising surgical stress and maintaining patients' physiological
function has yielded significant benefits, including shortened hospital
stays, reduced complications, and decreased healthcare costs.</p>
<p>TTSH has leveraged the ERAS¬Æ framework to systematically enhance its entire
perioperative care environment through three key innovation pillars - Process
Redesign, IT and Robotics Integration, and Strategic Job Redesign. This
holistic transformation of surgical care delivery exemplifies TTSH's commitment
to continuous healthcare innovation and improved patient outcomes.</p>
