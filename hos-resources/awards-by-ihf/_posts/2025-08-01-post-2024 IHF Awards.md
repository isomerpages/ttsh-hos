<summary>Project DEAR Patient (Discharge Early And Rest Patient)</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>A 2021 NUH patient survey identified key areas for improvement in the
discharge medication process, specifically focusing on wait times, updates,
and collection procedures. In response, NUH assembled an inter-disciplinary
team to reimagine and enhance the patient experience.</p>
<p>The team implemented several innovative solutions, including a multi-lingual
educational video explaining the discharge process and pharmacy visits.
They also introduced tele-counselling services for discharge medications,
allowing patients to receive consultation before arriving at the pharmacy.
Additionally, a new Pick-&amp;-Go service was launched, enabling eligible
patients to collect their medications without waiting for in-person counselling.</p>
<p>These initiatives yielded remarkable results by end-2022, with significant
improvements across all measured metrics:</p>
<p>¬∑ Discharge medication wait time satisfaction increased by six percentage
points to 94%</p>
<p>¬∑ Medication wait time update satisfaction improved from 81% to 89%</p>
<p>¬∑ Discharge medication collection process satisfaction showed the most
substantial improvement, rising from 88% to 97%</p>
<p>This comprehensive approach to service enhancement demonstrates NUH's
commitment to patient-centric care and continuous process improvement.</p>

<summary>Embracing AI, embracing the future of treatment</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>In 2023, NUH became Singapore's first hospital to adopt RapidAI, an innovative
AI platform that revolutionised stroke care. The system analyses patients'
CT scans within minutes, rapidly identify proportion of the brain that
has been damaged and parts of the brain that can potentially be saved through
medical intervention, and automatically alerting doctors. This technology
empowers clinicians to make faster, more informed decisions, significantly
reducing brain damage risk and improving patient outcomes.</p>
<p>Building on NUH's track record of healthcare innovation, the hospital's
NUHS@Home programme has transformed patient care delivery since its pilot
in 2020. The scheme, which enables patients to receive hospital-level care
in the comfort of their homes, has proven so successful that it has been
adopted as a mainstream care model across Singapore's public healthcare
system. Adopting a digital approach, NUH incorporates the use of the NUHS
app to optimise patient journey for registrations and payments. The app
is used by 85% of patients, and it empowers patients to actively participate
in their health management including appointment booking, checking of test
results, and accessing general health advice.</p>
<p>Together, these initiatives showcase NUH's commitment to leveraging technology
for better patient care.</p>
