<summary>Project DEAR Patient (Discharge Early And Rest Patient)</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>A 2021 NUH patient survey identified key areas for improvement in the
discharge medication process, specifically focusing on wait times, updates,
and collection procedures. In response, NUH assembled an inter-disciplinary
team to reimagine and enhance the patient experience.</p>
<p>The team implemented several innovative solutions, including a multi-lingual
educational video explaining the discharge process and pharmacy visits.
They also introduced tele-counselling services for discharge medications,
allowing patients to receive consultation before arriving at the pharmacy.
Additionally, a new Pick-&amp;-Go service was launched, enabling eligible
patients to collect their medications without waiting for in-person counselling.</p>
<p>These initiatives yielded remarkable results by end-2022, with significant
improvements across all measured metrics:</p>
<p>¬∑ Discharge medication wait time satisfaction increased by six percentage
points to 94%</p>
<p>¬∑ Medication wait time update satisfaction improved from 81% to 89%</p>
<p>¬∑ Discharge medication collection process satisfaction showed the most
substantial improvement, rising from 88% to 97%</p>
<p>This comprehensive approach to service enhancement demonstrates NUH's
commitment to patient-centric care and continuous process improvement.</p>
