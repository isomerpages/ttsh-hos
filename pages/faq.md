The Centre for Healthcare Innovation (CHI) is committed to transform healthcare, driven by its three thrusts: Promoting a culture of innovation through thought leadership, achieve better health and healthcare by enabling workforce transformation, and to catalyse value-based outcomes by effecting systems-level change.

Founded in 2016 on the concept of co-learning and collaboration, CHI and its network of 87 like-minded local and international partners create thought leadership, as well as co-build initiatives and programmes to inculcate a culture of innovation within healthcare.

Strengthened by this network, CHI has been able to customise and design signature programmes that aim to build a sustainable workforce via new andragogy and paradigms for our communities of carers and patients. To catalyse value-based outcomes and effect systems-level change, CHI's impactful platforms and initiatives drive innovation adoption and knowledge translation, consequently giving the healthcare community quicker access to the latest innovations.

CHI is enabled by our financial lever, the Ng Teng Fong Healthcare Innovation Programme that funds and supports healthcare innovation in collaboration with its partners through five (5) tracks – Strategic Training, Innovation, Community Enabling, Strategic Innovation, and Strategic Research.

The programme is managed by the TTSH Community Fund and CHI. Through meaningful and impactful collaborations, we will meet current and future healthcare challenges through innovative and value-driven care delivery to the populations we serve. For more information, visit www.chi.sg.
